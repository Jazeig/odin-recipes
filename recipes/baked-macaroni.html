        </ul>
        <h4>STEPS</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>First thing, cook macaroni pasta in a 
                large pot of the chicken broth until 
                just under al dente so it finishes 
                cooking in the oven. Then rub down an 
                8 by 11 or 9 by 13-inch baking dish
                 with the butter. Give it a good, 
                 generous layer of butter.</li>
            <li>Shred your cheeses and then add your 
                spices to the cheeses: A little 
                mustard powder boosts the cheddar 
                cheese flavor, salt and black pepper 
                are a must, garlic and onion powder, 
                and smoked paprika for that little 
                extra somethin'.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix in all of the 
                different cheeses, the half-and-half 
                and heavy cream. Mix in the cooked 
                macaroni pasta into the shredded 
                cheese, then give it a taste for 
                seasoning. Add a little salt if 
                needed, or black pepper or garlic, 
                whatever you want to boost up in 
                flavor. <strong> 2 and 3 are 
                interchangeable</strong>, we just want to make 
                sure to always taste for seasoning 
                before moving on to adding the 
                eggs!</li>
            <li>Then stir the eggs into the 
                macaroni mixture. Get it nice 
                and well-mixed before adding it to 
                the buttered baking dish and 
                spreading it evenly in there.</li>
            <li>Cover our mac in the remaining 
                cheese on top, sprinkle with 
                some smoked paprika, then bake 
                for 35-40 minutes. No, 
                there are no bread crumbs here, 
                we have a cheese crust instead. If 
                you want breadcrumbs, don't add the 
                cheese on top and use your favorite 
                breadcrumbs instead.</li>
            <li>Pull the mac and cheese from the 
                oven, let rest for five minutes 
                because a molten cheese burn is 
                not fun, then serve while still 
                gooey and delicious!</li>
        </ol>
